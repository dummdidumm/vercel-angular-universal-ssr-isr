<h1>ISR Route</h1>
<p>
  This random number should initally stay the same every 30 seconds, if you
  visit it directly (not through client nav):
  <span class="hydrate">{{ random }}</span>
</p>
<p>
  the vercel adapter is currently hard coded to use ISR on this route. Some kind
  of configuration API is necessary to make this configurable by the user.
